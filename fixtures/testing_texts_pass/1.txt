A Crow Looked at Me is the eighth studio album by Mount Eerie, a solo project of the American musician Phil Elverum. Released in 2017, it was composed in the aftermath of his 35-year-old wife, Geneviève Castrée's, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 2015 and her death in July 2016. Elverum wrote and recorded the songs over a six-week period in the room where she died, mostly using her instruments. The lyrics are presented in a diary-like form and sung in a raw, intimate style. They bluntly detail Castrée's illness and death, Elverum's grief, and his relationship with their infant child. It is soundtracked by sparse folk instrumentation. It was widely praised for its emotional potency. The album went on to be one of the most acclaimed albums of 2017 and of Elverum's career. His following albums, Now Only (2018) and Lost Wisdom pt. 2 (2019), further detail and examine Castrée's illness and early death.
